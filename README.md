# A Survival Guide to Software Engineering

A collection of free guidebooks with the goal of teaching the reader how to survive in the software engineering profession.

## Contents Overview

The following guides are contained (or at least planned) within this collection:

- **The Buzz**: An exercise in software engineering, taught through designing & building a simple full-stack messaging app.

## Compiling the Book Collection

If you have a good understanding of software engineering, compiling this collection should be easy:

1. Install Python 3.x (see [the official downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads))
2. **[OPTIONAL]** Use `git checkout ...` to checkout a different branch containing a more up-to date version
of the books you wish to build.
2. Run the `build.sh` script to compile the book.

The entire collection of books should now be compiled, and made available under the */build* directory
in the root of the repository.
