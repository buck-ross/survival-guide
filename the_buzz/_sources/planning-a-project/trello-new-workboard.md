# Trello: Your new Work Board

<!-- TODO: refactor this introduction -->
Now that you have a little bit of background information
on {term}`agile` development, the next step is to setup a {term}`work board`
so we can start planning out our project.
While some workplaces will still use physical whiteboards or corkboards
to represent their {term}`work board`, many modern software developers
will rely on online services to manage their {term}`work boards<work board>`,
as this will make it significantly easier for you and your teammates
to keep track of your tasks,
without needing to all be in the same room as each other.
We will be using one such online service, called [Trello](https://trello.com).

A board populated with columns
:::

Once you click "Create Board", you should be greeted
with a brand-new {term}`work board`, much like the one pictured in
{numref}`onboarding:profile:trello-new-board`.
At the moment, your {term}`work board` is a blank-slate, without anything on it,
but we can fix that by adding some columns to the board,
which we'll use to keep track of the state of each task you work on.

We'll start by adding columns for "To Do", "Doing", and "Done",
as depicted in {numref}`planning:trello:trello-board-columns`.
This 3-column board is the most basic, universal form
of {term}`work board` you'll encounter.
It is quite common to use more than just these 3 basic columns,
and indeed we will recommend adding more columns
as you progress through some of the later chapters,
but for now it is good to familiarize yourself with the basic 3 columns.

(don't forget \gls{work board}) -->
