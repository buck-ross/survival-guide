# Planning a Project

Software development is all about maintaining a proper balance between planning
and doing.
Too little planning leads to a lack of coordination within a development team.
This generally results in a lot of wasted time as each team member goes
in their own direction with the project,
ultimately leading them to produce several independent components
which don't work well together at all, instead of having a single,
cohesive project.

Too much planning, aside from being a waste of time in and of itself,
often puts teams in a position where they are unable to react quickly
to changes in their development requirements.
Teams which spend long periods of time planning and charting out their work
long in advance tend to have a much more difficult time reacting effectively
when circumstances force them to change course.

In this chapter, we will briefly go over the basics of software development,
including the principles
of the {term}`agile` and {term}`scrum` development methodologies.
Once we've established that, we'll then go on to demonstrate
how you and your team can apply these processes to your own projects.
