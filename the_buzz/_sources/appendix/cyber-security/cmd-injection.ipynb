    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "echo -n \"password123\" | md5sum\n",
    "```\n",

    "Which yields the password hash `482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38  -`.\n",

    "In this attack, we'll hijack this entrypoint to create a subshell to send a short `curl` command\n",
    "to the host through the password input in order to extract the credentials from the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",

    "One way to do this is by replacing `exec` with `execFileSync`, another function from the same package,\n",

    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const { execFileSync } = require('child_process');\n",

    "const hash = execFileSync('md5sum', [], { input: req.params.password }).toString();\n",

    "const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(req.params.password).digest('hex');\n",
