    "```js\n",
    "// Check the database for a user with the same username and password hash:\n",
    "db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='\" + req.params.user + \"' AND pwdhash='\" + hash + \"'\", (err, users) => {\n",
    "\t// ...\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice here that we are building our SQL query by concatenating a series of un-escaped strings.\n",
    "This is ripe for a type of attack known as *SQL injection*, in which the attacker sends the server a\n",
    "maliciously crafted set of inputs which are designed to trigger a malicious SQL command.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total Password Bypass\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the inputs `req.params.user = 'admin'`, with a password hash `hash = '0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661'`.\n",
    "This would result in the following SQL query:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND pwdhash='0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if instead of the `admin` user, we send a malicious input `admin'--`, we get the following SQL command:\n",

    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'--' AND pwdhash='0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note here that `--` is the SQL equivalent of `//`. IE, it comments out the rest of the line.\n",
